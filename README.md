# Mattify (should'a put'a hat on it)

It all started when I was backing up my WhatsApp messages and discovered that I had, for some reason, a video of my friend Matt repeating "this could be a web game".
I can't recall the context, but it was clearly something to do with my habit of making stupid webby interactives. It turned out that I had a lot of portrait videos
of Matt, so I stripped the audio from them all and made this silly tool. There's a couple of other people available too.

Go to https://mattify.abnib.co.uk/. Click a video, enter some text, click generate, and see the output. Click the resulting video to download it as an `.mp4` file
suitable for sending via WhatsApp or what-have-you.
